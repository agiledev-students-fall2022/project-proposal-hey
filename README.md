### Project title
Subsription Tracking App
### What and why?
It is an online subscription tracking app. Nowadays people have many subscriptions including video streaming services, music streaming services, shopping, cloud services, apps, news outlets, etc. It is getting harder to keep them organized and not forget when each payment is due or maybe the user wants to cancel the subscription after the trial period and timing is important. This app can help with that and make the life of users easier by adding all the subscriptions in one place with the payment details and dates so it can notify users when to pay. Another possible feature for family packages is to add other people to split the bill or choose the order in which they pay. 

### For whom?
Users are adults who pay for their subscriptions. There are 74.6m Netflix, 44.7m Spotify, and 48.6m HBO max subscribers in the US alone, so this app can be useful for many people.

### How?
The user chooses the platform inside the app and adds the details about the deadline and payment. At first, I imagined it to be a browser extension that can take this information from the website and automatically add it to the user's subscription list. Then, 3 days and 1 day before payment is due the app sends notifications. In the case of the family packages, the app, for example, will only notify the person whose turn to pay this month. It can also track how much money is spent every month.

### Scope
This app is pretty simple, but developers have many ways to improve it by making possible to connect to family packages, figuring out browser extensions, and optimizing it. A group of 4-6 can finish it by the end of the semester.
